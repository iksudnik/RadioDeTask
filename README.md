# Radio.de iOS Developer Position Test Assignment

## Project Overview

This repository contains my test assignment for the iOS developer position at Radio.de, showcasing my skills in building iOS applications with a focus on modern architectural and coding practices.

## Application Architecture

The project is built using the **MVVM+C (Model-View-ViewModel + Coordinator)** architecture. This design pattern facilitates the separation of concerns, simplifying testing and maintenance.

### Key Features:

- **UIKit with Programmatic UI**: Utilizing UIKit with programmatic constraints through Autolayout for flexible and dynamic UI design. Each `UIView` and `UIViewController` includes a `#Preview` for rapid prototyping and visual inspection.

- **Core Data**: Core Data is employed for persistent data storage, demonstrating the handling of local data storage and retrieval which is vital for offline data access and caching.

- **PointFree-like Dependencies**: Emphasizes struct-based dependencies, inspired by PointFree approaches, for cleaner and more maintainable code through dependency injection.

### Reviewer Feedback and My Reflections:

#### 1. **Core Data Usage for Large Data Sets**
   - **Feedback**: You have stored the downloaded data in core data  - in our apps this the essential way how we gonna deal with all the streaming service data.
   - **My Perspective**: While Core Data is a robust solution for data management, I acknowledge that for large files, alternative storage options could be more optimal. My choice to download files to the Documents folder aimed for simplicity, yet I recognize other system-designated folders could offer both security and user data privacy. This reflects my consideration for flexible and adaptable data storage strategies.

#### 2. **Decoupling Persistence and UI Layers**
   - **Feedback**: UITableView and CoreData can easily combined with each other with a few lines of code which is a standard way - your solution works, but needs more code.
   - **My Perspective**: My implementation intentionally avoids a rigid linkage between the persistence and UI layers, providing the flexibility to easily switch to alternative storage solutions like Realm. This approach underlines my commitment to modular and maintainable code architecture.

#### 3. **Use of Storyboards in UI Development**
   - **Feedback**: Using for the UI storyboards and Interface builder avoids unnecessary UI code - At least that the way we use it here.
   - **My Perspective**: While storyboards can be beneficial for solo projects, they pose significant challenges for team collaboration, primarily due to merge conflicts. My preference for programmatic UI and utilization of Xcode's Preview feature enhances clarity and avoids the limitations of storyboards. Moreover, I consider storyboards as increasingly obsolete with the advent of SwiftUI, which I would prefer for its efficiency and modernity, albeit hesitated to use, assuming it might be too novel for the project's current standards.

#### 4. **Details on OperationQueue Usage**
   - **Feedback**: A request for more detailed insights into using `OperationQueue` for task management.
   - **My Perspective**: Given that using `OperationQueue` was not a requirement, I opted for a more efficient solution through modern approaches, questioning the necessity of in-depth exploration of `OperationQueue`. My focus was on demonstrating effective and contemporary solutions that align with current development practices.

### Concluding Thoughts

The feedback received provided a valuable perspective on the intersection of traditional practices and modern development techniques. While I strive to innovate and optimize with the latest technologies, I understand the importance of aligning with a team's established methodologies. This project and its review have underscored the significance of balance between innovation and compatibility within team environments.
